# in server

we will be going over the backend setting up the routes, backend logic handling, connecting to database, making changes to database. We will also build authentication of user with help of JWT and cookies. Then moving on to more Twitter heavy features like following, unfollowing, creating tweets and exploring other user's tweets as well.

# in client

we will start adding in frontend ui using React and TailwindCSS. We will handle our routing using React Router DOM v6 and some styling with TailwindCSS. 
Then we will start adding in Frontend with Backend and start implementing features that read/write to our Database. We will then implement Redux to manage state in our Frontend App then move on to add new components to adhere to new features on each of our page.

In this project i used :
- React
- React-Redux
- Node.js
- Database (Mongodb, Firebase)
- Testing backend features with Postman
- Authentication (JWT Tokens, Cookies)
- Styling with Tailwind CSS
- React Router Dom v6
